## Verification Note

All URLs listed above were verified as of 2024. These represent real, accessible sources documenting actual historical research into alternative energy technologies. While the science remains controversial and largely unproven for commercial applications, the research itself is real and documented.

**Remember**: The Chicago Plasma Forest Network described on this website is a theoretical framework inspired by this research, not an operational system. Always verify sources independently and maintain scientific skepticism.
