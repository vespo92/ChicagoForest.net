 * Resource sharing economy for the forest network.
 * Like trees sharing nutrients through mycorrhizal networks,
 * nodes share bandwidth, storage, compute, and trust.
 *
 * Resource Types:
 * - Bandwidth: Network capacity for relaying
 * - Storage: Disk space for distributed data
 * - Compute: CPU/GPU for processing tasks
 * - Connectivity: Internet gateway access
 *
 * ⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is an AI-generated theoretical framework for educational purposes.
