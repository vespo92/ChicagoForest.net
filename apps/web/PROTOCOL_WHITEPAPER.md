# Chicago Forest Network Protocol Whitepaper

**DISCLAIMER: This is an AI-generated theoretical framework for educational purposes. Not operational infrastructure.**

## Abstract

The Chicago Forest Network represents a theoretical exploration of decentralized, community-owned wireless mesh networking combined with insights from historical free energy research. This document outlines the conceptual architecture and protocols that could enable such a network.

## 1. Introduction

The Chicago Forest Network (CFN) envisions a peer-to-peer wireless infrastructure owned and operated by community members. Drawing inspiration from Tesla's wireless power transmission research and modern mesh networking protocols, CFN proposes a decentralized alternative to traditional telecommunications infrastructure.

## 2. Protocol Stack Overview

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- WiFi (2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz)
- LoRa (900MHz ISM band)
- 60GHz backhaul links
- Custom RF equipment

### Layer 2: Mesh Routing
- BATMAN-adv for automatic mesh routing
- Babel protocol for hybrid mesh/wireless
- OLSR for mobile ad-hoc networks

### Layer 3: Network Layer
- IPV7 theoretical addressing scheme
- IPv6 compatibility layer
- Geographic-aware routing

### Layer 4: Transport
- End-to-end encryption
- Anonymous routing circuits
- Traffic padding for privacy

## 3. Node Types

### Plasma Node
Full network participant with:
- Multi-band radio capabilities
- Anonymous routing relay
- Local storage and caching

### Bridge Node
Connects CFN to external networks:
- SD-WAN integration
- WireGuard/VXLAN tunnels
- Traffic classification

### Relay Node
Lightweight mesh participant:
- Single-band radio
- Packet forwarding only
- Low resource requirements

## 4. Security Model

- Ed25519 node identity keys
- Per-hop encryption
- Onion routing for anonymity
- Zero-trust architecture

## 5. Deployment

This is a **theoretical framework** for educational discussion. Any actual deployment would require:
- Regulatory compliance (FCC Part 15, etc.)
- Proper RF engineering
- Community consensus and governance
- Extensive testing and validation

## 6. Conclusion

The Chicago Forest Network represents possibilities, not promises. It combines historical research with modern technology concepts to spark discussion about community-owned infrastructure and energy democracy.
