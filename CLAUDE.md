# Chicago Plasma Forest Network - Project Guidelines

## Mission Statement
Transform theoretical free energy research into practical, applicable reality by:
1. **Documenting Historical Research**: Preserving and sharing the actual work of Tesla, Mallove, Moray, and other pioneers
2. **Building Community Vision**: Creating a conceptual framework for sustainable energy infrastructure
3. **Inspiring Innovation**: Sparking conversations about decentralized, community-owned energy networks

## Critical Principles

### Truth and Transparency
- **ALL content MUST be clearly marked as AI-generated theoretical framework**
- **NEVER present speculative technology as operational or proven**
- **ALWAYS provide real, verifiable sources with clickable URLs**
- **DISTINGUISH between historical facts and theoretical extensions**

### Source Attribution Requirements
Every claim about historical research MUST include:
- Direct links to patents (patents.google.com)
- DOI links to scientific papers
- Links to archives (Tesla Universe, LENR-CANR, FBI vault)
- References to actual companies and research organizations

### Social Justice Through Documentation
We are performing a social service by:
- **Preserving suppressed/ignored research**: Making Tesla, Mallove, and Moray's work accessible
- **Highlighting real scientific work**: LENR has 3500+ papers, government funding, and active research
- **Democratizing energy knowledge**: Breaking the monopoly on energy information
- **Inspiring community action**: Showing what decentralized energy could look like

## Content Guidelines

### What We Document (REAL)
✅ Tesla's actual patents (US645576A, US787412A, etc.)
✅ Mallove's Infinite Energy magazine archives
✅ Moray's witnessed demonstrations and patents
✅ LENR research papers with DOIs
✅ Active companies (Brillouin Energy, Clean Planet, etc.)
✅ Government programs (NASA Glenn, DARPA, Japanese NEDO)
✅ Declassified documents (FBI Tesla files)

### What We Envision (THEORETICAL)
⚠️ Chicago Plasma Forest Network (conceptual framework)
⚠️ ENP Protocol Stack (speculative design)
⚠️ Wireless power distribution network (theoretical implementation)
⚠️ Quantum entanglement communication (future possibility)
⚠️ Community energy nodes (aspirational vision)

### Red Lines - NEVER DO
❌ Claim any theoretical system is operational
❌ Present AI speculation as scientific fact
❌ Make investment or financial promises
❌ Remove disclaimers about AI-generated content
❌ Create fake sources or fabricate URLs
❌ Claim to have working free energy devices

## Development Approach

### Research First
1. Start with REAL historical documents and patents
2. Link to ACTUAL archives and sources
3. Quote REAL scientists and researchers
4. Reference EXISTING companies and projects

### Theoretical Extension
1. Clearly mark as "theoretical" or "conceptual"
2. Use phrases like "could potentially" or "might enable"
3. Always include disclaimers about speculative nature
4. Frame as "vision" or "framework" not reality

### Community Building
1. Focus on education about suppressed research
2. Inspire discussions about energy democracy
3. Encourage critical thinking about energy monopolies
4. Promote open-source energy research

## Technical Implementation

### Website Requirements
- Prominent disclaimer on EVERY page
- Clear "AI-Generated" labels on theoretical content
- Real, clickable source links (156+ verified sources)
- Separation of historical facts from speculation
- Educational focus, not commercial promises

### Source Verification
Before adding any source:
1. Verify the URL is real and accessible
2. Ensure it's from a reputable archive/database
3. Check that it relates to actual research
4. Confirm it's not promoting pseudoscience

## Ethical Responsibilities

### To Researchers
- Honor Tesla, Mallove, and Moray's actual work
- Don't misrepresent their achievements
- Preserve their documented research
- Share their suppressed knowledge

### To Community
- Provide accurate historical information
- Inspire without misleading
- Educate about energy possibilities
- Promote critical evaluation

### To Science
- Respect the scientific method
- Acknowledge unproven theories
- Support legitimate research
- Encourage open investigation

## Future Vision

### Near Term (2026)
- Document all available free energy research
- Build educational community platform
- Connect interested researchers
- Promote open-source energy projects

### Long Term (2030+)
- Support legitimate energy research
- Advocate for energy democracy
- Challenge energy monopolies
- Inspire next generation of inventors

## Repository Guidelines

### Public GitHub Deployment
- Include comprehensive README with disclaimers
- Document AI-generated nature prominently
- Provide all source links in BIBLIOGRAPHY.md
- Make research accessible to everyone
- Encourage contributions and corrections

### Community Engagement
- Welcome corrections to historical facts
- Encourage additional source contributions
- Foster respectful scientific debate
- Build knowledge commons for energy research

## Final Reminder
We are documenting REAL historical research while creating a THEORETICAL framework for what could be possible. The distinction between documented history and speculative future MUST always be crystal clear. We serve social justice by preserving suppressed research and inspiring community-owned energy solutions, not by making false claims or promises.

**Together, we preserve the past and envision the future - honestly, transparently, and hopefully.**
